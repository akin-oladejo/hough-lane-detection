# Hough-Lane-Detection
Below is the code to detect lanes in a short driving video recorded on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. It uses Canny Edge Detection for line detection and the Hough transform to determine lane lines.

You would probably have to tweak parameters to get the lanes in a different video.
